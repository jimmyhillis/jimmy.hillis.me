My personal website and development blog. The budding start of a nodejs CMS.
This website is built with nodejs and will be built to support a jQuery + nodejs CMS system based on Jade templates and Markdown content.

## TODO v0.2b
- Cache last.fm play request server side
- Re-code Tweets.js to be a nodejs function that caches server side
- Build lab and folio pages

## TODO v0.3b
- Store .md data directly into a database (CouchDB)
- Build basic MVC functionality for updating the MD files directly within a pseude-CMS

## v0.1b
The current versions is the simple markup and some content as a proof-of-concept for how to build a CMS on top of a website.
