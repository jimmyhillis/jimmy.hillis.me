My personal website and development blog. The budding start of a nodejs CMS.
This website is built with nodejs and will be built to support a jQuery + nodejs CMS system based on Jade templates and Markdown content.

## v0.1b
The current versions is the simple markup and some content as a proof-of-concept for how to build a CMS on top of a website.
