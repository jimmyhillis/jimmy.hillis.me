Welcome to my lab. A collection of past, present and future projects or tidbits of code and color. Any code, that I'm allowed to share, will be on my [GitHub](//github.com/jimmyhillis) account and can be toyed with and critiqued.

Consider everything here a work-in-progress, but then isn't every code project?

### Comicbox.js
A vanilla JavaScript learning too in the form of a *completely* client-side collection tool. It allows you to enter and manage a your longboxes of comics without ever talking to a server.

TOOLS: JavaScript + HTML

### Kinetic CMS
A custom PHP content management system that focuses on *user simplicity* with complete content control, AJAX UX and multi-language support. It requires no more know-how than reading and filling out a form.

TOOLS: PHP + JavaScript + jQuery + LESS

## jQuery plugins
I've put together a few re-usable jQuery plugins and am working towards completing more and more for increased resuability in my code.

### inputToggle
This simple plugin allows you to have placeholder functionality in all browsers by doing a fallback that uses JavaScript to set and unset the default value for a field.

TOOLS: JavaScript + jQuery
