I live and work in Perth, Western Australia. It's never *truly* cold and it never rains so I ride my bike to work nearly every day. If you have anything to contact me about please tweet [@ppjim3](//www.twitter.com/#!ppjim3) or DM me.

I listen to lots of music and read way to many Spider-Man comic books. I sometimes play in a indie band called [@mymadflow](//www.twitter.com/#!mymadflow). We're putting the finishing touches on our second EP.

Je fait many different things, none of which interest the people I love let alone the people reading this.
