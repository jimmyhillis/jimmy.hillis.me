I'm an on-again off-again musician playing locally in Perth as well as writing and recording my own music. My band is called My Mad Flow and is currently on haitus due to life, however we're finishing and planning to release our second EP in 2012.

## My Mad Flow

[My Mad Flow](//mymadflow.com/ "My Mad Flow") is an indie five piece from Perth, Australia. With influences from the 60s to the punk attitudes of the 90s weâ€™re writing music you can live to. Come drink some wine with us and listen to some music. We always have something to say about everyone and everything.

We have released one EP [*We Cant Always Pretend We're Innocent*](http://itunes.apple.com/au/album/we-cant-always-pretend-were/id339652017 "Download We Can't Always Pretend We're Innocent") on iTunes. You can listen to a few tracks from Soundcloud

Our second record *You'll Find Meaning Where You Want It* will be released digitally in 2012. We've dropped a few tracks online so you can listen to those now.
