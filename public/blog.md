## Initial installation of node.js and express
### (12/May/2012)

I decided after doing research to build my own personal blog and folio website using node.js. It was enough process to get it all up and running and a very basic template for my site setup. I've decided to do everything in a very agile method. My basic plan includes building a modular website that will allow me to add and swap content that I deem useful to ahve on my site. While it is a folio site at it's core, it's hardly the main feature. I want to allow myself to express what I'm currently learning as well as what I'm spending my time on. Initially I will have the following strcuture:

1. *Folio*: A list of all the work that I'm proud of and willing to show off to the world.
2. *Lab*: A list (and examples) of projects that I'm working on. It's my environment to quickly prototype and show off little things that take my fancy. 
3. *Timesinks*: My directly non-work related interestes which will include things like my last.fm feed, twitter, instagram and so forth. This section will likely change all the time.

To get the project started I needed to install Node.js which was a simple matter of downloading and installing the Mac package from the website. This also gives me access to the NPM package system for installing more Node code. From here I installed express and a few other features to start my first experiement.

	npm install express

I've started a new folder structure for all my Node work, at least for now.

	xx/node_modules/xx
	xx/node/jimmy.hillis

With express I was able to bootstrap my first site

	$ node_modules/express/bin/express jimmy.hillis

This method build my basic express app file stucture and enough code to get me started. From there I quickly did some reading on th express documentation (http://expressjs.com/guide.html) and built a few routes and a few views. 

To build a route was extremely simple and I was able to retrofit some code they already provided for a few more routes.

The views are equally simple and, by default, make use of Jade templates (an extension of haml). Having never used the templates I figured I may as well give them a go and it was smooth sailing. They aren'y exactly difficult to follow and use a very abstract tab-delimited system to build html. For example to build a basic page:

	body
		div.mainwarp
			h1 This is my header
			p This is a great looking page!

This will build some very simple markup:

	<body>
		<div class="mainwrap">
			<h1>This is my header</h1>
			<p>This is a great looking page!</p>
		</div>
	</body>

A few things I really like is the simple way of chaining class and id properties after the element. 

	div#component.this-class.active

Is very short and simple and straight to the point. 

Having no need to closing tags (though you can manually close them yourself if you want) is a boon as well, saving a huge amount of time and effort. Using tabs and returns also forces the templater to write nicely formatting code.

## Twitter Bootstrap, installation and basics
### (13/May/2012)

I decided this morning to quickly get a few style issues sorted out. I've been meaning to look at a few CSS/HTML frameworks to get a feel for others code so decided to use the Twitter bootstrap on this site, at least initially.

Installation is easy: download the bootstap archive and drop the CSS and JS files where you need them. I've done that in my new express app in public/stylesheets/ and public/javascripts which could easily be added to my app layout.jade:

	link(rel='stylesheet', href='stylesheets/bootstrap.min.css')
	script(src='javascripts/bootstrap.min.js')

I also decided to fall back on the HTML5 Boiler Plate and found a simple conversion from plain HTML to Jade which allowed me to get it up and running immediately.

With all that installed I started building my Views through the layoute.jade (basic layout) as well as my route views. I've currently built the basic blocks for 4 pages and initial positining for aside elements.

My current plans for the site:

1. Build initial pages and allow for simple HTML markup.
2. Build a database model system for storing a few simple pieces of content through my new CMS idea.
3. Build Refl√©ter CMS which will allow me to edit all the content on the page, based on templates, without any need for models.

## Markdown formatting with Jade + Express
### (13/May/2012)

I've decided to write this blog purely with Markdown text (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) which has become a new love of mine over the last few months. It just allows me to worry about basic text without any formatting woes. If I want a few basic tools (lists, emphasis) I can do all of that easily, without any GUI.

I'm using iA writer (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id439623248?mt=12) to do my writing as the GUI is extremely simple, it looks great, and it works on all of my devices (over iCloud or Dropbox) whrever I happen to be. 

I wanted to get the "blog" up and running on my website so I needed to be able to take a direct copy of the .md file (can even pull it from Dropbox, which I may implement soon) and push that out as formatted HTML.

Node.js doesn't have any default Markdown support however there are plenty of tools already built. I happened across markdown-js first, so that's what I used. I don't imagine it's the best, but for now it's fine. 

Jade supports Markdown within it's filter system so you can easily do some basic Markdown to HTML formatting like so:

	div.copy
		:markdown
			*THIS* is markdown!

Which will build the following HTML:

	<div class="copy">
		<em>THIS</em> is markdown!
	</div>

Unforunately to use have the content directly in a variable doesn't work directly within Jade. This is a major shame, but from what I've read there is no non-programatic solution. Fine!

All you need to is compile the Markdown as HTML before passing the content. This was a trivial matter using the _markdown-js_ function that I mentioned.

	npm install markdown
	npm install -g markdown

That installs markdown and all required dependencies onto your machine. Now the code to open the file and convert:

	var fs = require('fs')
	, markdown = require('markdown').markdown;

	try {
		var blog = fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/../public/blog.md', 'ascii');
	} catch (err) {
		console.log("Error loading the Blog file");
	}

	blog = markdown.toHTML(blog);

You'll see two main pieces. First we open and read the Markdown file using the fs (file system) Node.js methods and then we convert the Markdown string to HTML. The _markdown-js_ setup is a little strange in that there is an Object within Markdown called markdown which has all the methods, but for now it does exactly what I needed. With that I pass the variable to my view and display it, without escaping, the HTML like so:

	.copy !{blog}

This creates a <div> with the Markup HTML within.
