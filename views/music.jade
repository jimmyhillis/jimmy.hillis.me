				some wine with us and listen to some music. We always have something
				to say about everyone and everything.

					My current project, which is made up of recordings done in the
					bedroom with a guitar and voice. Attempting to simplify everything I
					write and record and set limits to the amount of layers I use in
					hopes of writing songs that work, regardless of the complexity.

					This electronic record was recorded in 2002. It was a way for me
					to experiment with building songs without the use of a single real
					instrument. I made heavy use of a digital Moog synthesizer and was
					really happy with the results. Nothing too dancy, nothing too happy.
